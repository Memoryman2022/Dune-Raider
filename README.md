Paul Atreides<u/>Paul Atreides (10176 AG - 10219 AG), predominantly known as Muad'Dib, was the first Kwisatz Haderach, the last Duke of House Atreides from 10191 AG until 10196 AG, the first and founding Padishah Emperor of the Atreides Empire from 10196 AG until 10210 AG, and the supreme religious leader of the Fremen as the accepted Mahdi from 10193 AG onwards. The only son of Duke Leto Atreides I and Lady Jessica Atreides (n√©e Nerus), Paul's early years were overshadowed by suspicions of him as the Kwisatz Haderach.

<u>Lady Jessica</u>

ENEMIES

---

<u>Harkonnen Spinner</u>

<img src="https://github.com/Memoryman2022/Dune-Raider/blob/main/images/spinner.gif" alt="Spinner Image" width="500" height="500">

The Spinner is an unmanned craft designed to explode on impact. Its self guided pilot mechanisim oscillates on a sine wave frequency. Easy to destroy but hard to hit.

---

<u>Sardaukar Cruiser</u>

<img src="https://github.com/Memoryman2022/Dune-Raider/blob/main/images/cruiser.gif" alt="Spinner Image" width="500" height="500">

A lightning quick assault vessel designed fro rapier attacks. If you see one coming, evasion could be your best tactic.

---

<u>Harkonnen Ballship</u>

<img src="https://github.com/Memoryman2022/Dune-Raider/blob/main/images/ballship.gif" alt="Spinner Image" width="500" height="500">

Slower than the others but still formiddable especially on a highly populated battlefield. What the Ballship lacks in pace it makes up for in durability and requires heavy fire to eliminate.
