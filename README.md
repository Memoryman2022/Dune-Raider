ENEMIES

On the way you will face Harkonnen and Sardaukar craft which include:-


Harkonnen Spinner

The Spinner is an unmanned craft designed to explode on impact. Its self guided pilot mechanisim oscillates on a sine wave frequency. Easy to destroy but hard to hit.

Sardaukar Cruiser

A lightning quick assault vessel designed fro rapier attacks. If you see one coming, evasion could be your best tactic.

Harkonnen Ballship

Slower than the others but still formiddable especially on a highly populated battlefield. What the Ballship lacks in pace it makes up for in durability and requires heavy fire to eliminate.
