ENEMIES

On the way you will face Harkonnen and Sardaukar craft which include:-


<u>Harkonnen Spinner</u>

<img src="https://github.com/Memoryman2022/Dune-Raider/blob/main/images/spinner.gif" alt="Spinner Image" width="500" height="500">

The Spinner is an unmanned craft designed to explode on impact. Its self guided pilot mechanisim oscillates on a sine wave frequency. Easy to destroy but hard to hit.

<u>Sardaukar Cruiser</u>

A lightning quick assault vessel designed fro rapier attacks. If you see one coming, evasion could be your best tactic.

<u>Harkonnen Ballship</u>

Slower than the others but still formiddable especially on a highly populated battlefield. What the Ballship lacks in pace it makes up for in durability and requires heavy fire to eliminate.
